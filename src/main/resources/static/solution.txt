## Task 1
@RequestMapping is a class annotation that creates a "parent" route for all routes defined my methods in the class.
This means that several different mappings of different http methods(get, pots, put, delete) can be places under a prefix, like "/admin/".
@GetMapping marks a method as a handler for an http GET request made to the specified endpoint.
